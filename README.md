‚≠ê Don't forget to star this project! We welcome contributions, new features, and fresh ideas.

## Introduction

Let's take a scenario üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,

Whenever you go shopping with your family or friends, you might enter a clothing store filled with a wide variety of shirts, T-shirts, jeans, trousers, pants, socks, belts, and what not! The sheer number of options can be overwhelming, making it difficult to decide. Let's say you're looking for your dream shirt‚Äîthe perfect design, fabric, and color. However, finding that exact shirt can be challenging. Often, you either settle for something else with a bit of disappointment, or you leave the store still searching for that dream shirt.

That‚Äôs where the shopkeeper comes in. The shopkeeper knows exactly where your dream shirt is. They understand your personalized specifications and help you find your dream shirt, so you don‚Äôt have to search for it yourself.

Also, Your family and friends who are with you always help you find exactly what you need.

Wouldn't it be great if you could get these personalizations‚Äîthe help from the shopkeeper, family, and friends‚Äîon your e-commerce platform? Think about how much easier online shopping would be if you didn't have to figure everything out on your own.

That‚Äôs where Rakumon comes in. It‚Äôs a new type of e-commerce platform, a system where you have your own personalized online shopkeeper (AI). Where you can add your family and friends so all of you can shop online together. You can chat with each other, browse products together, and get personalized product recommendations and descriptions tailored to your needs from your online shopkeeper ‚Äî THE RAKUMON ü§ñ.

## Detailed Approach

## Try It Yourself!

### NOTE: Necessary Step

You need to create your own dataset and vector database. You can then retrieve products using Pinecone (recommended) or FAISS.
After creating your own dataset and vector database, please update the code in the necessary files as needed, especially `query_service_agent.py`.

If you want to access our vector database of products and our Pinecone retrieval method, or if you need help creating your own RAG, please contact these members of the project.

### STEPS

1. If you have completed the 'Necessary Step' as provided above, First run the `query_service_agent.py` file. It will run the RAG pipeline.
   ```
   python3 query_service_agent.py
   ```
2. Second, run the `gemini_chat_agent.py` file. It will run the Chat agent pipeline.
   ```
   python3 gemini_chat_agent.py
   ```
3. Finally, run the `main.py` file. It will start the project on localhost, allowing you to interact with Rakumon. Feel free to add or update user details in `users.json`, and then change the user ID in the `main.py` file accordingly.
   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```
