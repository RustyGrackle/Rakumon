## Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's take a scenario,

Whenever you go shopping with your family or friends, you might enter a clothing store filled with a wide variety of shirts, T-shirts, jeans, trousers, pants, socks, belts, and what not! The sheer number of options can be overwhelming, making it difficult to decide. Let's say you're looking for your dream shirt—the perfect design, fabric, and color. However, finding that exact shirt can be challenging. Often, you either settle for something else with a bit of disappointment, or you leave the store still searching for that dream shirt.

That’s where the shopkeeper comes in. The shopkeeper knows exactly where your dream shirt is. They understand your personalized specifications and help you find your dream shirt, so you don’t have to search for it yourself.

Also, Your family and friends who are with you always help you find exactly what you need.

Wouldn't it be great if you could get these personalizations—the help from the shopkeeper, family, and friends—on your e-commerce platform? Think about how much easier online shopping would be if you didn't have to figure everything out on your own.

That’s where Rakumon comes in. It’s a new type of e-commerce platform, a system where you have your own personalized online shopkeeper (AI). Where you can add your family and friends so all of you can shop online together. You can chat with each other, browse products together, and get personalized product recommendations and descriptions tailored to your needs from your online shopkeeper — THE RAKUMON.
